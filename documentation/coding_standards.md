## Coding standards

Keeping code consistent is the most important thing when we want to maintain A huge project in good shape. If every element looks the same it's easier to bypass boilerplate code and focus only on important logic.

### JavaScript

For JavaScript code, it's recommended to use the Airbnb style guide. It's bulletproof and easy to follow. It's available on [the GitHub platform](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

### C++

C++ code is styled based on Microsoft guidelines with a few minor changes. Styling has been exported from CLion as XML and is [available here](./formatting/cpp_formatting.xml). If the IDE of your choice doesn't support this style formatting, then you can use [this file](./formatting/cpp_formatting.clang-format) for the CLang formatter that is industry standard but offers fewer lint options.
