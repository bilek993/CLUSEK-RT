## Resources standards

Not only code requires standardization, but also other important resources. With proper rules collaboration on this project is convenient.

### JSON

The JSON format is a first-class citizen in this game engine and is used widely to store data in a human-readable form. Using three spaces as an indentation character is highly recommended. Also to keep files properly formatted it is recommended to use formatting tools, like [Curious Concept JSON Formatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/). Usage example:

```
{
   "ExampleNumericValue":12.3,
   "ExampleTextValue":"test123"
}
```
