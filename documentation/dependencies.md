## Dependencies

This project uses external dependencies. Those dependencies are split into two categories: JavaScript and C++. The first category is responsible for JavaScript dependencies, that are used for script tools and those dependencies are not included in this repository. To download this package, a tool named [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is required. With one simple command (that is: `npm install`), all modules can be downloaded. The second category is responsible for C++ dependencies that are used as the core of the CLUSEK-RT. Those dependencies are partly included in this repository as git submodules and can be downloaded when cloning this repository.
