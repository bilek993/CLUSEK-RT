CLUSEK-RT
==================================

**CLUSEK-RT** is a complex game engine written in C++ and the successor of the [CLUSEK game engine](https://github.com/bilek993/CLUSEK). This engine has been designed with a cross-platform design in mind. Thanks to [Vulkan API](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/) it delivers a next-gen experience with ray tracing to both Linux and Windows platforms. The main principle of the engine is "Push ray tracing to the limit" and it delivers it to the end-users without any compromises.
